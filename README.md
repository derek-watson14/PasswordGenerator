# PasswordGenerator

This is my attempt at the third homework of the UW Full Stack Bootcamp. Our task was to write Javascript that would generate a random password,
based on user input collected through alerts, prompts and confirms.

The hardest part of the project for me was organizing my thoughts before hand and determining what needed to be done. In that way, it was
a good exercise in writing pseudo code and planning before coding.
